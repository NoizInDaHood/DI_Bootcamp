"""Challenge 1: Letter Index Dictionary
Goal: Create a dictionary that stores the indices (number of the position) of each letter in a word provided by the user(input()).



Key Python Topics:

User input (input())
Dictionaries
Loops (for loop)
Conditional statements (if, else)
String manipulation
Lists


Instructions:
1. User Input:

Ask the user to enter a word.
Store the input word in a variable.
2. Creating the Dictionary:

Iterate through each character of the input word using a loop.
And check if the character is already a key in the dictionary.

    * If it is, append the current index to the list associated with that key.
    * If it is not, create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
Ensure that the characters (keys) are strings.
Ensure that the indices (values) are stored in lists.
3. Expected Output:

For the input “dodo”, the output should be: {"d": [0, 2], "o": [1, 3]}.
For the input “froggy”, the output should be: {"f": [0], "r": [1], "o": [2], "g": [3, 4], "y": [5]}.
For the input “grapes”, the output should be: {"g": [0], "r": [1], "a": [2], "p": [3], "e": [4], "s": [5]}."""

word = input("Please enter a word: ")
charact_valueindex = {}
for character in word:
    if character in charact_valueindex:
        charact_valueindex[character].append(word.index(character))
    else:
        charact_valueindex[character] = [word.index(character)]
print(f"\nThe dictionary with the characters and their indices is: \n\n{charact_valueindex}")
