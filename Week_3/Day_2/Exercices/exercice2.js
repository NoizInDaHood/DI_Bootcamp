// Exercise 2 : Shopping List
// Instructions
// const stock = { 
//     "banana": 6, 
//     "apple": 0,
//     "pear": 12,
//     "orange": 32,
//     "blueberry":1
// }  

// const prices = {    
//     "banana": 4, 
//     "apple": 2, 
//     "pear": 1,
//     "orange": 1.5,
//     "blueberry":10
// } 
// Add the stock and prices objects to your js file.

// Create an array called shoppingList with the following items: “banana”, “orange”, and “apple”. It means that you have 1 banana, 1 orange and 1 apple in your cart.

// Create a function called myBill() that takes no parameters.

// The function should return the total price of your shoppingList. In order to do this you must follow these rules:
// The item must be in stock. (Hint : check out if .. in)
// If the item is in stock find out the price in the prices object.

// Call the myBill() function.

// Bonus: If the item is in stock, decrease the item’s stock by 1
